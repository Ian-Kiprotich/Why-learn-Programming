I started dabbling in code during March 2015, but not really committed until a year later in June. My main reason behind learning to program was to build a successful business out of a website that would help people learn to fly. So far (at the time of writing this) I have learned HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, and many other frameworks like JQuery, Ajax, Laravel, etc.

Here are a few reasons why it is good to learn programming:

>It teaches you how to solve complex problems
>>It makes you more resourceful
>>>It's an in-demand skill
>>>>You develop new habits and approaches for life
**Firstly**, programming teaches you how to solve complex problems. Most people are problem-oriented, they only think about the problem at hand. However, programming gives you the ability to look at things from a new perspective. It allows you to break down anything into simple steps to create a whole "program" that accomplishes your goal (like an algorithm). Want to make a million dollars? Great! Start with the end in mind (the $) and develop blocks of actions that will help you get there.

**Secondly**, you'll become much more resourceful. Let's face it, you're not going understand new technology when you're a novice. Most of your time will be spent reading documentation/instructions on the coding languages you're programming trying to resolve some type of error. Programming is all about solving problems. You'll be doing a lot of testing, reading and debugging. This is also great because you'll learn that there are usually more than 5 ways to solve a single problem you're experiencing. Which means you'll always have the opportunity to learn.

**Thirdly**, the world is built on code. Learning to program strategically is smart because you'll have in-demand skills. Although I've been programming for a year, I've already been able to make extra money building sites for others. If making money isn't your goal with learning to code, at the very least, you'll have a solid understanding of technology used today and can view the world differently.

**Lastly**, you'll usually become more productive the more you write code. There is a special approach to programming. I often find myself using the same methods to solve problems and test hypothesis in my personal life. For example, I've used this technique to pay off debts, pass college courses, and even speak effectively. This is because the underlying principle of programming is always two things: beginning with a goal in mind and transitioning problems into solutions by breaking down the issue into more manageable tasks.

So should you learn to program/code? Definitely!

5. Work from home
Because programmers use computers for their work, you might have the opportunity to work from home. Many programming positions allow for remote work. Even if your primary job isn't programming, you may devote some period of your workweek to coding, and you can do that portion of your work from home. Another benefit of working from a laptop or home computer is that you might be able to change job locations without affecting your commute or needing to move to a new house.

6. Improve your efficiency
With programming skills, you can potentially design applications that allow you to be a more efficient employee. You can write code to automate processes you do regularly, allowing your computer to work in the background while you focus on tasks that require human input. You can also develop apps or websites that customers can access or download. This scalability can potentially enhance your reach compared to physical stores or advertisements, which require customers to be in specific physical locations.

7. Start your own business
Your programming skills can be helpful if you want to start your own business. You can work as a freelance programmer or use your coding skills to support any other business you start. For example, you might be able to build and customize your website or run an online storefront without hiring a website designer. As a freelancer, you can design and run websites for others, create independent applications or sell training courses or one-on-one mentorships to other people who want to learn to code.

8. Work abroad
Because programming skills are helpful internationally, you can consider living and working abroad as a programmer. You might have an easier time securing work in a foreign company compared to someone without programming knowledge. You could work remotely for a company in your home country or as a freelancer while spending time abroad.

12. Improve your logic and reasoning skills
Programming requires you to write logical code with a predictable cause-and-effect relationship. You learn how to find places where you have accidentally inserted problems into the code and how to fix them. Identifying these issues requires you to break down a piece of code into smaller parts and consider the code as a whole as well. This type of logical thinking can be helpful in other real-world situations. 

13. Improve your attention to detail
Something as small as a missing punctuation mark can disrupt a piece of code. Learning to code could help you develop your attention to detail because it requires you to look quickly and methodically for these potential errors. You can also practice avoiding making these mistakes in the first place.
Related: Scripting vs. Programming: What's the Difference?

14. Build perseverance
Because code is dependent on accuracy, you may experience incorrect coding. When errors occur, you usually have to think about possible sources and look for and identify them to find ways to correct them. Although this process can take time, it can help teach you not to give up during difficult situations. In this way, you can develop a habit of keeping a positive mindset despite challenges.

15. Grow your creativity
Programming has the potential to be a very creative field. You can generate code from nothing, starting with only your goals for the final product. Because of the open nature of coding, you can experiment with various codes to produce the most efficient one while still achieving your goals. You can also use your programming skills to enhance your other creative pursuits, for example, by building games.

When you work on coding projects with others, you usually have to communicate with people with varying goals and levels of training. If you work primarily in programming, you may explain the inner workings of your job to others in a way that they can understand with little education in the field.
If you're a freelancer designing a website for someone else's business, you might help them determine what's realistic for the needs of their business and make sure you clearly understand their needs and goals. Suppose you're working as part of a team responding to comments from the public, such as fixing bugs in an application. In that case, it may be helpful to communicate both with your team and your customers in a clear, professional and solution-focused way.

17. Join a community
When you learn to program, you can communicate with other people who share your skills. You can join professional organizations and attend conferences or local groups to work on projects together. There are also many online communities for people interested in programming so that you can communicate with professionals from many different backgrounds, skill levels and cultures about your shared interest.
