I started dabbling in code during March 2015, but not really committed until a year later in June. My main reason behind learning to program was to build a successful business out of a website that would help people learn to fly. So far (at the time of writing this) I have learned HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, and many other frameworks like JQuery, Ajax, Laravel, etc.

Here are a few reasons why it is good to learn programming:

>It teaches you how to solve complex problems
>>It makes you more resourceful
>>>It's an in-demand skill
>>>>You develop new habits and approaches for life
**Firstly**, programming teaches you how to solve complex problems. Most people are problem-oriented, they only think about the problem at hand. However, programming gives you the ability to look at things from a new perspective. It allows you to break down anything into simple steps to create a whole "program" that accomplishes your goal (like an algorithm). Want to make a million dollars? Great! Start with the end in mind (the $) and develop blocks of actions that will help you get there.

**Secondly**, you'll become much more resourceful. Let's face it, you're not going understand new technology when you're a novice. Most of your time will be spent reading documentation/instructions on the coding languages you're programming trying to resolve some type of error. Programming is all about solving problems. You'll be doing a lot of testing, reading and debugging. This is also great because you'll learn that there are usually more than 5 ways to solve a single problem you're experiencing. Which means you'll always have the opportunity to learn.

**Thirdly**, the world is built on code. Learning to program strategically is smart because you'll have in-demand skills. Although I've been programming for a year, I've already been able to make extra money building sites for others. If making money isn't your goal with learning to code, at the very least, you'll have a solid understanding of technology used today and can view the world differently.

**Lastly**, you'll usually become more productive the more you write code. There is a special approach to programming. I often find myself using the same methods to solve problems and test hypothesis in my personal life. For example, I've used this technique to pay off debts, pass college courses, and even speak effectively. This is because the underlying principle of programming is always two things: beginning with a goal in mind and transitioning problems into solutions by breaking down the issue into more manageable tasks.

So should you learn to program/code? Definitely!
# DAY 2/100
Computer programming is a versatile skill with various uses across industries and professions.
Because we rely so much on computers for daily tasks, those who know how to program have many job opportunities.

**17 reasons why you should learn programming**

*Here are 17 reasons that programming is a valuable skill:*
From : https://www.indeed.com/career-advice

1. Grow in your current job
Programming knowledge doesn't just benefit those who work in computer science or related fields. For example, people who work in marketing, design, sales and customer relations for technology products can use programming training to enhance their skill sets. Marketing requires data collection and analysis of customer demographics and sales trends to guide advertising strategies, and designers with programming skills can create digital advertisements. People who work in customer-facing positions can use their programming knowledge to assist with queries about technical issues.


2. Enhance your marketability for a new job
In some cases, you could be a more appealing candidate if you pursue programming skills. This can give you increased flexibility in the job market. If the job you're applying for doesn't require programming, you can still use your skills to suggest different ways you can bring value to your prospective employer and demonstrate your dedication to self-improvement. If you want to work in technology, your coding skill set may be sufficient to get a job without a bachelor's degree. You can enhance your resume even without a degree by earning certificates or diplomas.


3. Improve your performance as an employee or leader
Programming skills could give you a better idea of what your colleagues do daily. As an employee or manager, this knowledge could allow you to communicate more easily with technical support staff, your website development team or other teams working with computers. With this understanding, you could try to set goals and deadlines within a realistic time frame.

4. Increase your income
In a non-programming job, your programming skills could increase the range of tasks you can perform for your employer. Doing additional work can increase your value as an employee, which you could use to negotiate for a higher salary. You can also potentially leverage your skills and value to broaden your job title or seek a promotion. By having more credentials than other candidates, you might also be able to pursue a higher starting salary at a new job.

5. Work from home
Because programmers use computers for their work, you might have the opportunity to work from home. Many programming positions allow for remote work. Even if your primary job isn't programming, you may devote some period of your workweek to coding, and you can do that portion of your work from home. Another benefit of working from a laptop or home computer is that you might be able to change job locations without affecting your commute or needing to move to a new house.

6. Improve your efficiency
With programming skills, you can potentially design applications that allow you to be a more efficient employee. You can write code to automate processes you do regularly, allowing your computer to work in the background while you focus on tasks that require human input. You can also develop apps or websites that customers can access or download. This scalability can potentially enhance your reach compared to physical stores or advertisements, which require customers to be in specific physical locations.

7. Start your own business
Your programming skills can be helpful if you want to start your own business. You can work as a freelance programmer or use your coding skills to support any other business you start. For example, you might be able to build and customize your website or run an online storefront without hiring a website designer. As a freelancer, you can design and run websites for others, create independent applications or sell training courses or one-on-one mentorships to other people who want to learn to code.

8. Work abroad
Because programming skills are helpful internationally, you can consider living and working abroad as a programmer. You might have an easier time securing work in a foreign company compared to someone without programming knowledge. You could work remotely for a company in your home country or as a freelancer while spending time abroad.

10. Improve your understanding of the world
Because computers run much of the modern world, developing programming skills can help you understand how many things work around you. For example, you might be able to keep up with developments in computing and automation and advise friends and family about new technologies that interest them or with which they need assistance. If you have children, you might better understand the applications and online teaching tools they use in school and help them navigate those technologies more efficiently.

11. Develop problem-solving skills
Coding relies fundamentally on problem-solving. Because there are multiple approaches to writing code for a given situation, learning programming can help you develop your problem-solving skills as you think and work through different solutions. The flexibility inherent in coding can help you practice looking at a problem from many perspectives and generating several possible answers. Creative problem-solving is a skill that can transfer to other aspects of your work and daily life.

12. Improve your logic and reasoning skills
Programming requires you to write logical code with a predictable cause-and-effect relationship. You learn how to find places where you have accidentally inserted problems into the code and how to fix them. Identifying these issues requires you to break down a piece of code into smaller parts and consider the code as a whole as well. This type of logical thinking can be helpful in other real-world situations. 

13. Improve your attention to detail
Something as small as a missing punctuation mark can disrupt a piece of code. Learning to code could help you develop your attention to detail because it requires you to look quickly and methodically for these potential errors. You can also practice avoiding making these mistakes in the first place.
Related: Scripting vs. Programming: What's the Difference?

14. Build perseverance
Because code is dependent on accuracy, you may experience incorrect coding. When errors occur, you usually have to think about possible sources and look for and identify them to find ways to correct them. Although this process can take time, it can help teach you not to give up during difficult situations. In this way, you can develop a habit of keeping a positive mindset despite challenges.

15. Grow your creativity
Programming has the potential to be a very creative field. You can generate code from nothing, starting with only your goals for the final product. Because of the open nature of coding, you can experiment with various codes to produce the most efficient one while still achieving your goals. You can also use your programming skills to enhance your other creative pursuits, for example, by building games.

16. Develop your communication skills
When you work on coding projects with others, you usually have to communicate with people with varying goals and levels of training. If you work primarily in programming, you may explain the inner workings of your job to others in a way that they can understand with little education in the field.
If you're a freelancer designing a website for someone else's business, you might help them determine what's realistic for the needs of their business and make sure you clearly understand their needs and goals. Suppose you're working as part of a team responding to comments from the public, such as fixing bugs in an application. In that case, it may be helpful to communicate both with your team and your customers in a clear, professional and solution-focused way.

17. Join a community
When you learn to program, you can communicate with other people who share your skills. You can join professional organizations and attend conferences or local groups to work on projects together. There are also many online communities for people interested in programming so that you can communicate with professionals from many different backgrounds, skill levels and cultures about your shared interest.

Reasons Why You Should Learn How to Code
Here's why you should learn to code: Even if you don't work in tech, coding can improve your job prospects and add valuable skills to your resume. It can also change the way you think and open career paths for jobs that use coding.

Your Job Application Will Stand Out
Hiring managers in tech look for coding skills. Many tech job applications come with a long list of required programming languages. But even outside of the tech sector, listing programming languages on your job application can help you stand out.

That's because knowing how to code demonstrates an ability to learn new technologies and showcase strong problem-solving skills. Even in fields that do not directly require coding, programming indicates transferable skills.

You can also stand out by linking your coding skills to your field. If you work in healthcare, explain how coding allows you to analyze large datasets effectively. If you're in graphic design, link your programming skills to your ability to communicate information visually. Hiring managers will likely take notice of your skillset.

It Can Boost Your Career
In almost any field, coding skills can boost your career. That's because an ability to code can take your career to the next level. Consider a business analyst who learns how to code. They can open new opportunities, including in business analytics and data science, with coding skills. Or coding can help them stand out at their next annual review.

Learning to code can mean qualifying for promotions or specialized roles. If you're a teacher, learning to code can help you move into specialized teaching roles or become an instructional technology specialist.

Freelancers who learn to code can broaden their job prospects and take on higher-paying work. Get creative about how coding can benefit your career — and think strategically about which programming language to learn.

Find the Right Coding Bootcamp For You
It Can Enhance Your Skill Set
Employers look for all kinds of technical and people skills — also known as hard and soft skills. And when evaluating resumes, hiring managers want to see evidence of your skill, not simply a bullet point that says "strong problem-solving skills."

Adding a programming language to your skill set can demonstrate your abilities. It can also complement your current knowledge. If you work in a people-focused career, learning to code can strengthen your reasoning and logic skills. And if you're in an analytical field, coding can sharpen your ability to work with data.

Consider your strengths and areas for growth. A programming language can add a valuable tool to your skill set and demonstrate your commitment to learning.

You May Be Able to Enter the Tech Industry
The tech sector offers above-average salaries and strong demand. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projects the computer and IT field will add 682,800 new jobs between 2021-2031. And these occupations report a median annual salary of $97,430.

It's easy to see why many people want to move into tech. But what's the best programming language to learn if you want to pursue tech jobs? Many recommend learning Python first. With a more readable syntax, it can be easier for new learners. Plus, Python prepares developers for careers in software development and data analysis.

Before learning your first programming language, consider which languages best fit your strengths and career goals. And then try out a few different options to learn to code. Some people learn best from online classes or tutorials, while others prefer formal training programs.

It Can Help You Understand Other Aspects of Tech
Technology increasingly influences every area of life. And understanding programming languages can give you insight into other areas of tech.

Your Way of Thinking Will Change
Learning to code changes the way you think. Coding requires strong logical thinking abilities and the patience to solve problems.

Programmers communicate commands to computers, and they often need to think creatively when coding. If a section of code fails, programmers need to identify and correct the problem. Coding also requires innovation. To achieve a particular result, you'll need to try several possibilities to reach your goal.

Whether you use coding in your job or treat it as a hobby, learning a programming language will test your cognitive skills and shape how you approach problems.

# DAY 6/100

*From :https://www.preface.ai/blog/why-coding-is-important/*

*Many people learn coding because of their career development, or simply because of their interests, but the benefits are much more than that. Steve Jobs once said, “Everybody should learn to program a computer, because it teaches you how to think.” When you know how to think, you open up endless possibilities to your work and life. Whether you're a parent looking for kids coding courses, or you're a working adult who's trying to upskill yourself, check out 10 reasons why we should learn to code below.*

1. Coding Develops Logical and Computational Thinking
Coding encourages the use of logical reasoning and algorithms to create programs. When tackling a new challenge, you must employ a logical approach to find a solution, thus exercising and enhancing your logical abilities.

This process is a key part of 'Computational Thinking', an essential skill in today's digitised world. It's about breaking down complex issues, recognises patterns, and develops step-by-step solutions. In Preface School of Technology, we teach students to think critically, apply effective reasoning, and solve problems across various contexts, enhancing their analytical skills.

This skill is not only crucial for coding but also beneficial in everyday life, promoting structured thinking and problem-solving. A huge part of Preface’s educational philosophy is about Computational Thinking, as we aim to equip children and adults with unique problem-solving skill sets that they can apply in their personal and professional lives in the future.

2. Coding Improves Problem Solving Skills
Coding teaches you how to think. During the coding process, you need to give a solution to an issue that involves intensive problem-solving skills. It trains your brain to think deeply, identify the troubles, and break things up, then put the pieces together with a solution. These kinds of troubleshooting skills help you become a smarter person personally and professionally and see a situation from a completely new perspective.

3. Coding Fosters Creativity
Someone might think coding is boring with standard formulas, but it can be fun and creative. There won’t be the same problems to be resolved every time, you will overcome different kinds of challenges that require new solutions. While working on coding projects, you can make use of your creativity to provide a tailored solution to an issue – and your innovative solution might somehow change the world.

4. Coding Allows High Income Potential

Programmers and developers are in high demand all over the world. Companies are willing to provide attractive packages to them. From the recent survey of SalaryExplorer, the median salary of a developer or programmer in Hong Kong is HK$33,800 per month, ranging from HK$15,600 to HK$53,800 per month while the report by Census and Statistics Department indicates the median monthly income for general HK labour force in December 2023 was only HK$19,800 per month.

5. Coding Opens Up Job Opportunities
Technology is a growing trend in the digital economy providing massive job opportunities. Programmers, software engineers, and prompt engineers, are in high demand across different industries. With coding as the fundamental skill, you open up career choices. It also makes your portfolio stand out from the others. Many companies might also outsource their coding-related works, thus, being a coding expert helps you earn freelance income, and offers career flexibility as a digital nomad.

6. Coding Helps You Work Smartly And Efficiently
Coding is not only useful for technical roles, it also helps in non-coding jobs. When you know how to code and apply Computational Thinking, you can automate the operational progress or apply the way of thinking in marketing campaigns. Even just knowing basic coding helps you communicate with technical colleagues effectively, thus enhancing the overall efficiency of the projects.

7. Coding Take Your Career to New Heights
Learning to code helps you accomplish innovative projects and make you a valuable asset to the company. With Computational Thinking, you can visualise and understand the risk and challenges from an engineer’s point of view, making you a great teammate or leader to work with. Coding skills also help you leverage data and logical thinking in decision making, thus achieving better performance.

8. Coding Help You Understand How Technology Works

# DAY 7/100

From: (https://potomac.edu/why-learn-programming/)

The accelerating technological developments characterize the 21st century. It is all around us, from the alarm clock on our phones that wakes us up in the morning, to the coffee machines that can brew our coffee with just a push of a button.

Behind most everything we see on the internet—every word, picture, chart, layout, etc.—there is someone who programmed it to look as such to us. So why should you become a programmer? Here’s a list of some of the reasons.
>
1. It Guarantees You a Job
We’re living in the era of technology, and technological growth is nowhere near stopping. As the use of technological devices is growing every year, there will always be a high demand for programmers. The Bureau of Labor Statistics stated that within this decade, computer programming jobs would mostly be available to those outside the United States. This due to the fact that companies are considering employing people all around the world since they would pay them lower wages.

However, jobs such as software developing, web developing, computer system analysts, and others show a good career outlook for the next 10 years. Their estimated growth is from 9% and up to 21% for software development jobs.
>
2. No Need for a Four-Year Degree
While one of the paths to becoming a programmer is to earn a computer science degree, you can still become one without a degree. Many coding jobs don’t require a computer science or an IT degree; instead, they’re interested in your coding skills and coding languages you know. This means that even though a degree would be useful and open several doors for you, it isn’t a must.

However, there are other options other than a degree, that could potentially help you land a job. For instance, if you were to get a software development or cybersecurity diploma, it would certainly look good in the eyes of the hiring manager. The same goes for a certificate too; if your CV has relevant certificate programs in it, such as network security management for example, that along with your skills will leave a good impression.
>
3.You Get to Work From Home
work-from-home
Since the job only requires a computer with an internet connection, employees often have the opportunity to work remotely. That being said, that depends on the company’s policy, but many offer such an option. Moreover, if you work as a freelancer, your job will always be done remotely.

This advantage makes programming a highly sought-after job for people who want to balance their work and family life and feel like commuting wastes their precious time they could have spent differently. It also allows them to apply for jobs across the country without the need to relocate and worry about the distance of the office.
>
4. You Can Create Anything You Want
Computer programming, like no other job, gives you the opportunity to digitize your ideas. This idea can include an app you wanted to create and thought that would go viral once you put in the market. However, creating an app, it’s not an easy task as it requires effort, time, and money. While in other scenarios, you would pay a developer to put to life your plans and ideas, being a programmer yourself, you would spare your money and get to develop the app exactly how you want it. Especially since,  let’s be honest, no one can implement your idea exactly how you want it to be.
>
5. High Income Potential
Money can be motivation in most jobs and the case with programming is no different. Most jobs you can get with programming skills tend to have higher than average salaries. While the salary of a programmer depends on the state and the type of job, the median salary of a computer programmer is $84,280, while a software developer’s median salary is $103,620.
>
6. You Understand How Software Works
When we use the computer, we interact with it through mouse and keyboard, but we don’t really stop and think about the program running in the background. Programming will get you familiar with the software, programs, devices, and websites and will help you understand them. Due to this familiarization, you will grasp and adopt new technology tools much more quickly.
>
7. It Teaches You Persistence
Learning computer programming teaches you to see the problems in the light of solutions. For every problem you may face, you start to brainstorm ideas on how to solve it. Fruitful results that come out of brainstorming and fixing problems will give you a positive outlook, and toughen you up to act on the problem however hard it may be. You become determined to find a way to work out a solution, becoming this way a solution-driven person.
>
8. You Learn To Combine Technical Skills and Creativity
reasons-you-should-learn-programming
Not all industries will give you the opportunity to use both your technical and creative skills as programming will. This is possible due to the nature of the job. It focuses on identifying issues and resolving them. However, there won’t always be the same problems to solve, that’s why you’ll get to solve them while also finding new solutions each time. This makes programming a very challenging and exciting career.
>
9. You Develop Problem Solving Skills
In the world of programming, it is often said that coding is all about solving problems, and computer programs should solve problems for us. Learning programming is more or less coding and determining how to tackle the issues that arise during coding and finding solutions for them. The more you get to solve these problems, the more practical it becomes. You might even start applying this problem-solving mindset in different aspects of your professional life and not only while coding.
>
10. Open Your Own Business
Becoming self-employed is the path that many programmers eventually chose. Knowing how to code allows you to look into opening a business of your own. This could be an online shop, having your own website designing company, building mobile applications, offering online coding courses and tutoring, and many more. The opportunities are endless. What makes it even better is that the demand for these kinds of businesses is also high.

Programming is a skill that comes with numerous benefits. Some of the advantages that come with knowing code are a guaranteed job, getting to create interesting applications, developing problem-solving skills, and sometimes even the opportunity to work from home. We hope we convinced you to start learning to code. Happy coding!

> In the modern digital era, the terms “Code” and “Coding” have become ubiquitous. From tech to startups, education to entertainment, coding is a fundamental skill driving innovation and powering the digital world. But what exactly is code, and What is code entail? Let’s dive in and explore these concepts

>> In our real life, to communicate with each other we use different languages such as English, Hindi and Marathi. Similarly, to communicate with computers we use a Binary language/ Binary Code( 0s and 1s) because computers understand 0’s as ‘off’ and 1’s as ‘on’. We can also say that computers use electrical signals, 0s low voltage and 1s high voltage.

>>> Code is basically a set of instructions written in a programming language that computers can understand and execute accordingly. It serves as a communication bridge between humans and machines, allowing us to directly access the action of a computer to perform a particular or specific task and solve problems.


>>>> Code can be written in various programming languages such as C, Java, Python and JavaScript which follows a particular syntax, structure and methods that ensures clarity and functionality. By writing a code, developers can manipulate the data, control flow, control hardware and build software that ranges from simple to complex systems, ultimately transforming abstract ideas into digital solutions.

* What is Coding?
  From : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/why-should-i-learn-coding/
Coding refers to the process of writing instructions for a computer to perform a specific task. It involves using a programming language to create a set of commands that a computer can understand and execute. The goal of coding is to design and implement algorithms, which are step-by-step procedures or sets of rules, to solve a particular problem or achieve a desired outcome.

7 Reasons Why You Must Learn Coding
A lot of people before entering the programming field are curious to know how things work behind the scene? How within a few seconds Google give us a search result for whatever we are looking for? How we are able to connect to someone on Facebook around this world? How does Google Maps really work to give us direction anywhere in this world? All the above reasons inspire a non-programmer to choose this field. Today we all are dependent on technology in our daily life, for entertainment, for communication, and for everything but very few people know how to read and write code. If you are already coding for years, you will be able to apply this skill beyond your computers. We are surrounded by a lot of problems and coding has given us a lot of solutions in the real world. It doesn’t matter if you are a non-programmer, beginner, or experienced person, there are multiple reasons you should learn to code. 


“Everybody in this country should learn how to program a computer… because it teaches you how to think” 
–Steve Jobs


1. Attractive Salary and Multiple Career Opportunities
Technology is vast and there are plenty of job opportunities available if you know how to code. Programmers are high in demand all over the world. You can become a freelancer and work freely, you can work for some companies, you can work on your own side projects or you can also use your coding skill for your own startup. The salary of programmers is also attractive because it requires critical thinking and situation analysis. People who are masters in programming work for a few hours but earn more also they are more flexible in their daily lives to do their job. Below is the estimated salary of computer programmers in India. 

2. Develop Problem-Solving and Logical Skills
Problem-solving skill is the heart of programming and learning programming is about breaking up problems into smaller chunks, using your own logic and algorithms to create a program, and then giving a solution for that. Coding forces your brain to think about a problem deeply, organize your thoughts for the same, apply some logic, and then provide a solution. Every time you face a new challenge, you need to use your brain, you may have to make your own rule and you need to follow a logical approach. 

So learning and doing programming is an exercise for your brain that eventually improves your problem-solving and logical ability. Learning to code will teach you to understand this world, to solve the problems we encounter every day in our life and that is the best thing you can do to change this world. You help people by using computer technologies and you earn respect for that too. You eventually become a smarter person when you see the whole picture of the real-world problem and you solve that using your logical approach. 

3. Develop Interpersonal Skills
Coding not only improve your technical skill, but it also helps in improving your soft skills. Most of the time when you are working in a team you need to collaborate with other co-workers, you may have to discuss the project with them, you need to interact with your manager and all these things eventually develop your soft skill which not only helps in building a good relationship in your professional life but also in personal life. Magic happens in coding when you collaborate with other smart people and build something together that actually something meaningful for people in this world. 

4. Technologies Are Ruling the World
Technology is embedded everywhere and there is no doubt that it has become a part of our daily life whether it’s entertainment or we have to communicate with someone or we have to go somewhere. We are relying on technologies and there are thousands of industries dependent on computer programs to run their business operations. Scientists use computers to analyze and see the results of their experiments and for their own research. It is used in data analysis, finance, food industry, education, customer service, health sector from creating an app or website useful for others to drive a car. It’s strange that from morning to evening we are relying on technologies but very few people know how to code. 

5. Coding is Creativity
Coding is always considered as all about something computational, mathematical, frustrating, and boring but there is a creative side of coding as well. When programmers see something is imperfect in this world then it becomes their job to analyze the problem and to give a visionary solution. They see a complete picture of a problem people encounter and they use their creative logical approach to find out the solution for that. Just like painters, a clever programmer picks a suitable programming language, design patterns, and patterns of logical expression to implement the solution. 

6. Understanding of Both Sides of the Equation in Business
In any kind of industry or business, it always becomes difficult for a non-programmer or departments who have to do nothing with coding to understand the complete process that requires to get the job done. A misunderstanding is always developed between engineers and non-programmers when it comes to finding a solution for a specific problem. When you have the coding skill, you can visualize or at least understand the risk, challenges, and time from an engineer’s point of view. It doesn’t matter if you are a manager, team leader, or marketer in your company if you know about coding, you understand both sides of the table. You are able to tackle the problems smoothly and that’s very important to run a business successfully. 

7. Empowering and Life-Changing Experience
Programming always gives you a new challenge where you have to take a risk every time and that teaches you how to take the risk in your life too. The world is full of software, apps, and website and when you build these things on your own you feel more confident and powerful. When a programmer is able to solve a problem that had no solution before it becomes a life-changing experience for them. 


Whether you want to uncover the secrets of the universe, or you just want to pursue a career in the 21st century, basic computer programming is an essential skill to learn. 
– Stephen Hawking 


Overall, learning to code can be a valuable skill that opens up numerous opportunities, enhances your problem-solving abilities, and equips you with the tools to navigate an increasingly technology-driven world. Whether you pursue a career in programming or use coding skills as a supplement to your existing expertise, the benefits are substantial.

  >Why learn to code? 5 Surprising benefits to consider
>>The benefits of learning to code can be surprisingly wide-ranging. Here are a few of the ways learning to code can benefit you.
>>> From : https://www.rasmussen.edu/degrees/technology/blog/why-learn-to-code/
1. Demand remains strong for coding-related jobs
What good is a strong salary if no one is looking to hire for the position? When it comes to coding-related jobs, it appears there’s still plenty of opportunity.

Here are the current BLS projections for employment growth in the same coding and programming-related professions:

Web developers: 13%
Network and computer systems administrators: 5%
Computer programmers: -7%
Database administrators: 9%
Software developers: 21%
When compared to the national average of five percent growth, you can see that a handful of positions are outpacing a lot of other careers. Computer programmers are an interesting outlier from this group, but some believe these projections are influenced by computer programming skills blending into other related in-demand tech roles.

While the role is still extremely valuable, more and more hybrid positions are being introduced into the workforce. This has resulted in less “computer programmer” job postings, and more opportunities that combine programming skills into other job titles.

2. Coding ability gives new perspective to problem-solving
“Learning to code has the inadvertent effect of teaching you how to think,” says Adrian Degus, CEO of Nuvro. He goes on to explain that he used to be more prone to solving problems emotionally. But his coding experience has taught him to approach problems logically.

“Understanding logic, at a deep level, has improved my problem-solving proficiency tenfold,” he adds.

Coding, in its most basic terms, is really just assigning a computer a task to do based on the logical guidelines you’ve outlined. Highly complex tasks are essentially a collection of smaller operations once you break them down. This methodical and logic-heavy approach to problem solving can be a boon for figuring out problems beyond a coding challenge.

Hilary Bird, senior developer at Get CenturyLink, agrees with this sentiment, saying learning to code has benefited her personal and professional life by encouraging her to take a step back and approach situations from a new perspective. “I can break problems down into small, separate parts and figure out how each is affecting the other,” she explains. “This helps me decide what area of the problem to focus on first.”

3. Learning to code offers career flexibility
Learning to code can help open up new areas of opportunity in your career and ultimately make you a more flexible candidate in a rapidly-shifting digital economy. Daniel Davidson, owner of Dan Design Co., started his career in print design but noticed he was consistently missing out on opportunities due to a lack of coding knowledge.

“The single greatest skill I have picked up for my professional life has been learning how to code,” Davidson says. “Had I not learned to code, I would have been out of work years ago. It’s been liberating and very lucrative.”

Davidson adds that even if your job doesn’t require you to have a deep understanding of coding or programming languages, it still helps because you’ll likely need to interact with another person who does. Learning to code, even as a hobby, can give you a common reference point and better understanding of those who tackle some of the more complex programming and coding roles out there.

4. Learning to code can be a fun bonding opportunity for families
How often do you have the opportunity to learn something practical and new with your kids? Parents with school-aged children have the chance to start from square one together as they learn the fundamentals of programming and coding.

“My 10-year-old son actually decided to learn to code around the same time I did,” Degus says. “It was a challenging but very rewarding experience. To this day my son and I talk coding over the dinner table, while the rest of the family makes fun of us for being geeks.”

Christopher Prasad, marketing manager at JookSMS, points out that involving your kids can be a great way to keep yourself accountable as well as teach them important skills as the value of coding will only increase.

“Schools in the UK have now actually introduced coding to younger children so they know what it takes to design apps, websites and more, and I think it's a brilliant idea going forward and developing the younger generation,” he says.

One excellent way to test the waters of learning to code is to practice with kid-friendly resources like Scratch, which gives both you and your child an introduction to programming fundamentals and systemic reasoning. This fundamental understanding will help you as you move on to more complex languages and applications.

5. Coding can be useful in jobs you might not expect
You might think coding and programming skills are only valuable for people working in highly technical specialist jobs. While it’s true that learning to code is more important for some roles, that doesn’t mean you can’t find practical ways to apply coding knowledge in non-coding jobs.

Software architect and entrepreneur Mark Billion says his coding knowledge has benefited him in unexpected ways as a business professional.

“We were able to use Python to code our advertising algorithms, which also saved us about $1,000 per month,” Billion explains. “So, if you are in business—any kind of business—coding is critical.”

The ability to code allowed Billion to automate menial tasks that ultimately saved him money. That’s a huge plus for small businesses where budgets are typically very tight.

For those who work closely with programmers and developers, learning the basics of coding can make you a much more valuable member of a team.

“While I’m primarily a marketer, having technical knowledge is one of the biggest assets I can provide my team,” says Jake Lane, growth manager at Press Cleaners. “Being able to make a change to the code base helps free up our developers to focus on the more important stuff and reduces development lag time.”

You don’t have to be a programming whiz to reap the benefits of learning to code. Knowing just enough to be useful can still be a positive asset in most business environments.

 # *Putting coding skills to work*
Why learn to code? As you can see, there are plenty of good reasons why coding is important. Whether it’s just for fun or as a form of professional development, you’re sure to enjoy the benefits of learning to code as you build a foundation of tech skills.
>>> Some reasons why you might code

> Coding is fun
The act of coding can be fun in itself because there is just so much code you can write that is completely unique. It is the same type of idea why a person might write a novel or go for a hike. You enjoy the activity for the activity itself and other benefits just seem to flow in as a result.

>> It’s a paycheck
Maybe you are motivated to code because it pays well and you want to live a certain lifestyle or have certain things. This motivation may be more of a means to an end, rather than the coding itself.

>>> The daily challenges
Coding can definitely be a series of daily challenges, whether that is solving a specific bug, designing a specific element, or maybe finding some way to optimize something. Every day seemingly can bring something new, keeping every day fresh.

>>>> The logical thinking
Coding requires a way of thinking that is more logical and step by step. After all, it is giving instructions to a computer, which only operates based on logic and step driven instructions. Some people might fit right into this line of thinking with their personality.

>>>>> Constantly changing landscape
Similar to the daily challenges, but at a higher scope, coding is always changing. You have new techniques, new languages, new frameworks, and more coming out constantly. Some stick around, some don’t, but each can be learned from.

>>>>>> The teamwork, or the solo
Some might code for the team and the sense of accomplishment that comes with the teamwork to completely a project. They might hunger for the social interaction of a close-knit group with the same purpose. On the flipside, you might code because you don’t necessarily have to work with a team. Maybe you like the fact that you write your own code and learn on your own.

>>>>>>> The design and organization
Coding in different applications across every industry means different design challenges, not only for the end-user, but also organizing your code and architecture. This is a challenge in itself that can drive people to code.

>>>>>>>> The responsibility
When working on a project for a client, company, or some end-user, there is going to be a level of responsibility that comes with coding. You are responsible for that code doing what it is supposed to do, which can fill a need that some people might have. This responsibility could also come from some side-effect of the coding, like the responsibility of supporting a family.

>>>>>>>>>> The end result
Maybe your purpose is driven by the need to complete a project. Or maybe it is the need for the compensation at the end. For this, coding might not always be enjoyable in the moment, but for the satisfaction of the outcome.

>>>>>>>>>>> The praise
Some might have the personality where they need to have praise for the work they perform. This could be compensation in a job, a number of “likes” for your github project, or some other form of praise.

*Why should everyone learn programming?*

> Quite often I hear or read that everyone should learn how to code. That coding skills will benefit us in the future and even learning the basics will improve our lifes.

>> I just don't understand how coding skills could directly benefit an average person if the person doesn't directly work in a tech field or similar.

>>> For example, I had a basics of programming in school but writing Hello world, drawing a moving figure or making a calculator hasn't really helped me with anything yet.

>>>> I often wonder why is programming being popularised so much and why they try to teach it at schools and the earlier, the better. I feel like most of the subjects taught at school usually could be applied to everyday life or at least improved our understanding of the world around us, the processes, history, economy, etc., but I feel that coding might be too specific.

> How can computer programming or coding help the world?
It’s challenging to think of a way computer programming wouldn’t help the world. Nearly the entire globe is either connected or readily seeking ways to increase connections. Computer programming offers many different benefits for the world, such as:

>> Research and development: Research relies on data, and machines can help researchers aggregate, analyze, synthesize, and visualize data in ways human beings have not been capable of before. Programming skills allow people to build the vehicles that connect machines and humans.


>>> Government operations: Coders are responsible for large portions of the government’s digital transformation. New online portals allow citizens, organizations, and businesses to access government services more efficiently.

>>>> Web development and design: Designers leverage computer programming skills to build online experiences in fields like eCommerce or entertainment. These sites provide access to the information and services held within the digital world and rely on user research to create experiences.

>>>>> Marketing and business operations: Computer programmers can also help businesses manage operations by building apps and tools for internal use or customer-facing solutions.

>>>>>> Data science and artificial intelligence: These exploding fields require software engineers to build environments suitable for processing and visualizing the data necessary to train models for data science and machine learning projects.


>>>>>>>> Cybersecurity: Developers also build the solutions we need to keep our online interactions safe from threat actors. Mastery of different programming languages can help students launch their careers in this in-demand information technology sector.



# DAY 15/100

> **How Does Coding Work?**  

>> Computer programming languages, developed through a series of numerical or alphabetic codes, instruct machines to complete specific actions. Computer coding functions much like a manual.

>>> A programmer or developer writes instructions describing the information and tasks needed to create a visual or to perform a task. Computers scan extensive coded manuals very quickly, executing the tasks that create and run a successful website or application. Displaying an image or section of text, changing font styles, and opening emails all require instructions included in the coded manual.

>>>> Users interact with websites and apps with the help of these coded instructions. The code itself does not show up on the screen. Instead, people see the words and images a developer or programmer asks the computer to display.

>>>>> Coding tells a machine which actions to perform and how to complete tasks. Programming languages provide the rules for building websites, apps, and other computer-based technologies. Each programming language helps humans accurately communicate with machines.
