# Why-learn-Programming
DAY 1/100

I started dabbling in code during March 2015, but not really committed until a year later in June. My main reason behind learning to program was to build a successful business out of a website that would help people learn to fly. So far (at the time of writing this) I have learned HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, and many other frameworks like JQuery, Ajax, Laravel, etc.

Here are a few reasons why it is good to learn programming:

>It teaches you how to solve complex problems
>>It makes you more resourceful
>>>It's an in-demand skill
>>>>You develop new habits and approaches for life
**Firstly**, programming teaches you how to solve complex problems. Most people are problem-oriented, they only think about the problem at hand. However, programming gives you the ability to look at things from a new perspective. It allows you to break down anything into simple steps to create a whole "program" that accomplishes your goal (like an algorithm). Want to make a million dollars? Great! Start with the end in mind (the $) and develop blocks of actions that will help you get there.

**Secondly**, you'll become much more resourceful. Let's face it, you're not going understand new technology when you're a novice. Most of your time will be spent reading documentation/instructions on the coding languages you're programming trying to resolve some type of error. Programming is all about solving problems. You'll be doing a lot of testing, reading and debugging. This is also great because you'll learn that there are usually more than 5 ways to solve a single problem you're experiencing. Which means you'll always have the opportunity to learn.

**Thirdly**, the world is built on code. Learning to program strategically is smart because you'll have in-demand skills. Although I've been programming for a year, I've already been able to make extra money building sites for others. If making money isn't your goal with learning to code, at the very least, you'll have a solid understanding of technology used today and can view the world differently.

**Lastly**, you'll usually become more productive the more you write code. There is a special approach to programming. I often find myself using the same methods to solve problems and test hypothesis in my personal life. For example, I've used this technique to pay off debts, pass college courses, and even speak effectively. This is because the underlying principle of programming is always two things: beginning with a goal in mind and transitioning problems into solutions by breaking down the issue into more manageable tasks.

So should you learn to program/code? Definitely!
